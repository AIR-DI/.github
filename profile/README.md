# AIR-DREAM Lab
Welcome to AIR-DREAM (Decision-making Research for Empowered AI Methods) Lab code repository. ! AIR-DREAM Lab is a research group at [Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR)](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. Our research focus is to develop advanced learning-based data-driven decision-making theories and practical technologies that are robust, generalizable, and deployable to tackle real-world challenges. We work on fundamental learning algorithms, robust robotic control methods, optimization technologies for real-world AIoT systems, and data-driven decision-making tools & libraries.

:fire: **We are hiring**: we are looking for postdocs and student interns. If you are interested in the research directions of data-driven decision-making, please feel free to contact us!
